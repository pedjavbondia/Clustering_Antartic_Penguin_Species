# Clustering_Antartic_Penguin_Species
Unsupervised ML was applied to cluster groups of penguins with similar characteristics.

Goal: Identify groups in the dataset

Applied Model: KMean

Index of the Project:

1. Import of Dependencies and Load of the dataset.
2. Scaling Data to reduce the effect of the difference magnitude in features.
3. Determine the best number of clusters for KMeans by graphing Inertias vs N_clusters. 
4. Construction of a Pipeline with Scaler and KMeans.
5. Include the predicted labels in the dataset as "Cluster" column.
